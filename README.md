Venn Visceral: Nissan Leaf powered gokart

Description: I wanted an electric gokart that was way more powerful than the basic ones and the qs series.
So, I'm putting a 2015 Gen 2 Nissan leaf motor and battery pack into a gokart
General Specs:
- Currently: 80kW (107hp), ~180ftlb
- Modded (Future): 140kW (187hp), ~400ftlb
- Weight goal: 1200lbs
- Size goal: 7.5ft x 4.5ft

This was previous partially free and partially only available to patreon members.
However, due to the open source community that surrounds many aspects of this project, I have decided to make it all open source here.
